# Pytorch Neural Network

A neural network that can:
- take 2 inputs:
  - an image from MNIST dataset, and
  - a random number between 0 and 9
- and gives two outputs:
  - the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image, and
  - the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network
